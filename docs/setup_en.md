# Manual Randomizer Setup Guide

## Required Software

* Archipelago is required. Check out [the official guide](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en)!

## Installation Procedures

Place the .apworld in your Archipelago installation's `lib/worlds` folder.

## Joining a MultiWorld Game

Open the Archipelago launcher and select "Manual Client". You'll need to put the name of the apworld (probably something like `DeadByDaylight-Killer-C31`) into the "Manual Game ID" box, and the normal connection details into the other one.

## Multiplayer Manual

Get ye yamls and generate! See [the official guide](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en#generating-a-game) for details... if you dare! Hee hee hoo hoo!

## Game Troubleshooting

It's a Manual, so if something's broken it's probably my fault. You're in the Manual discord, right? Post in the thread there and @ me about whatever broke. Post error messages if you got 'em.
