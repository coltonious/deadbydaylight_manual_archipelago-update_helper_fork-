# Manual - Dead By Daylight (Killer)

## What is a Manual game?
A Manual game is an Archipelago game where you keep track of things... manually! You'll manually mark locations checked, and you'll manually restrict what items you use based on the items you've been sent. 

## Where is the settings page?

The player settings file should be nearby wherever you're reading this. If not, though, you can also run the Archipelago Launcher and select "Generate Template Settings" to generate a new template file. You can find a guide on working with settings ('yaml') files here: https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/advanced_settings/en

## What does randomization do to this game?
Your access to Perks and Killers is restricted, until you or other players find them as items in the multiworld. Your locations are granted when winning* a game while using a given Killer or Perk.

### About Winning*

Dead by Daylight is an asymmetric, 4v1, ***multiplayer*** game where victory can mean many things. For the purposes of a fun multiworld experience - and for fun games with other players - I recommend counting **eight or nine hooks** as a 'victory'. 
While it might be tempting to aim for a 3K or a 4K, I find that this can become draining and encourage playstyles that aren't fun for either team.

## What is the goal of this randomizer?
The goal is to win* with a certain number of killers. The number of killers required for victory can be selected in the settings file.

## Which items can be in another player's world?
Killers are shuffled, and can end up in any player's world.

If Perk Shuffle is enabled, Perks will also be sent to other worlds.

## How is DLC handled?
For the sake of convenience, each Killer can be turned off in the settings file. This will also remove their Perks from the game if Perk Shuffle is enabled.
If you don't own a DLC, simply turn off its Killer in the settings file.
